# Regulatory Tools

Automation infrastructure for generating structured, traceable,
machine-derived regulatory artifacts for SaMD projects.

---

## 1. Purpose

This repository provides tools for:

- Requirement parsing
- ID validation
- Traceability matrix generation
- Evidence aggregation
- CI-integrated compliance checks

The objective is deterministic, machine-generated regulatory documentation.

---

## 2. Design Philosophy

Regulatory documentation should be:

- Derived from structured data
- Automatically verifiable
- Deterministic
- CI-enforced

Manual document assembly should be minimized.
